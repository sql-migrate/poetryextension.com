Dear Poetry and Dance Lovers,

We’ve been so happy to bring you <a href="http://www.thepoetryextension.com">poetry readings</a> and poet/dancer interviews for the past (nearly) four years.

It has been, and continues to be, a pleasure getting to know so many artists from around the world. We know that several publishing houses have listed our interviews in their authors sections online, and that many poets who are also lecturers direct their students to our site.

While this has been a labour of love, it has also been something we (Natalya, Neil and our son, Sam) have funded alone. As we are not a “group” per se, nor a “collective” or an “event”, it has been impossible to get funding.

Going forward, we’d be honoured if those of you who enjoy The Poetry Extension would consider donating a small token of support.

For every $10 Canadian, or £5 UK, we will donate $2 or £1 to rape crisis charities in Canada and the UK.

Thank you for your kindness and consideration. With your support, we look forward to bringing you more transatlantic readings and interviews!

With Love,
The Poetry Extension Family
